### Description

- A small e-commerce system that allows for the selling and purchasing of items.
  - Customers can register and search for items they would like to purchase.
  - Sellers can register and display items they would like to list to sell.
- <u>Note</u>: this project was built with a focus on development using a SQL datastore as opposed to building, deploying, and scaling an online cloud service. Some parts of the system that were not the focus were intentionally simplified.

### Directory Structure

  - the home directory for the Express back-end
